# GARB Zinc 2018 Code Challenge

This challenge has been sponsored by the development team at Grab.

For me, Grab is a really challenging and awesome place to work. Even when I'm working on something quite difficult — I like it even more.

Nicolas Dellinger, Security Engineer.

We hope you feel the same way about The Zinc Challenge — it's a tough one, so we're looking forward to seeing how you do!

At Grab, we believe in driving change and improving people’s lives. That’s why we created Southeast Asia’s most innovative ride-hailing app, giving passengers speed, safety & certainty in their daily commutes. We now offer an extensive portfolio of transportation services, including 2-wheels, 4-wheels, bicycles, as well as a suite of financial services including payments and lending. We’re growing rapidly, and are constantly on the lookout for brilliant talents.

We're looking for great developers to join our team and help us expand even more.
